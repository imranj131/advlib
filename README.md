advlib
======

Library for wireless advertising packet decoding.  Currently supports the following protocols:
* [Bluetooth Smart (BLE)](#bluetooth-smart-ble-advertising-packet-library)
* [reelyActive RFID](#reelyactive-rfid-library)


Installation
------------

    npm install advlib


Hello advlib
------------

```javascript
var advlib = require('advlib');

var rawHexPacket = '421655daba50e1fe0201050c097265656c79416374697665';
var processedPacket = advlib.ble.process(rawHexPacket);

console.log(JSON.stringify(processedPacket, null, " "));
```

The console output should appear as follows:

    {
      type: "ADVA-48",
      value: "fee150bada55",
      advHeader: { 
        type: "ADV_NONCONNECT_IND",
        length: 22,
        txAdd: "random",
        rxAdd: "public" 
      },
      advData: {
        flags: [ "LE Limited Discoverable Mode", "BR/EDR Not Supported" ],
        completeLocalName: "reelyActive" 
      } 
    }


Bluetooth Smart (BLE) Advertising Packet Library
------------------------------------------------

Process a raw packet (as a hexadecimal string) with the following command:

    advlib.ble.process(rawHexPacket);

The library is organised hierarchically so that the separate elements of a packet can be processed individually.  Refer to the index below for details on each element:

* [Header](#header)
* [Address](#address)
* [Data](#data)
  * [Generic Access Profile (GAP)](#generic-access-profile-gap)

### Header

Process a 16-bit header (as a hexadecimal string) with the following command:

    advlib.ble.header.process(rawHexHeader);

For reference, the 16-bit header is as follows (reading the hexadecimal string from left to right):

| Bit(s) | Function                      |
|-------:|-------------------------------|
| 15     | RxAdd: 0 = public, 1 = random |
| 14     | TxAdd: 0 = public, 1 = random |
| 13-12  | Reserved for Future Use (RFU) |
| 11-8   | Type (see table below)        |
| 7-6    | Reserved for Future Use (RFU) |
| 5-0    | Payload length in bytes       |

And the advertising packet types are as follows:

| Type | Packet           | Purpose                                |
|-----:|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0    | ADV_IND          | Connectable undirected advertising     |
| 1    | ADV_DIRECT_IND   | Connectable directed advertising       |
| 2    | ADV_NONCONN_IND  | Non-connectable undirected advertising |
| 3    | SCAN_REQ         | Scan for more info from advertiser     |
| 4    | SCAN_RSP         | Response to scan request from scanner  |
| 5    | CONNECT_REQ      | Request to connect                     |
| 6    | ADV_DISCOVER_IND | Scannable undirected advertising       |

For example:

    advlib.ble.header.process('4216');

would yield:

    {
      rxAdd: "public",
      txAdd: "random",
      type: "ADV_NONCONNECT_IND",
      length: 22
    }


### Address

Process a 48-bit address (as a hexadecimal string) with the following command:

    advlib.ble.address.process(rawHexAddress);

For reference, the 48-bit header is as follows (reading the hexadecimal string from left to right):

| Bit(s) | Address component |
|-------:|-------------------|
| 47-40  | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:## |
| 39-32  | xx:xx:xx:xx:##:xx |
| 31-24  | xx:xx:xx:##:xx:xx |
| 23-16  | xx:xx:##:xx:xx:xx |
| 15-8   | xx:##:xx:xx:xx:xx |
| 7-0    | ##:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx |

This is best illustrated with an example:

    advlib.ble.address.process('0123456789ab');

Would yield:

    {
      type: "ADVA-48",
      value: "ab8967452301"
    }

which can alternatively be represented as ab:89:67:45:23:01.
