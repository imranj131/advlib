advlib
======

Web front-end for advlib via GitHub Pages.  Currently supports the following protocols:
* [Bluetooth Smart (BLE)](#bluetooth-smart-ble-advertising-packet-library)
* [reelyActive RFID](#reelyactive-rfid-library)

See the [advlib master branch](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib) for more detailed documentation, or [advlib on npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/advlib).


How we create this using browserify
-----------------------------------

#### Installing Browserify

[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) is a beautiful tool which bundles up and concatenates NodeJS modules for use in browser environments.  

To get started with browserify, install browserify globally with npm:

    npm install -g browserify

or

    sudo npm install -g browserify

#### Integrating Back-End Logic to Front-End Code

Feel free to require NodeJS modules you need to run your app, or any npm modules you need in order to write your AngularJS code for the browser in web/js/advapp.js. 

    var advlib = require('advlib');
    var angular = require('angular');

If at this point you are confused that you are using NodeJS's module loading system for your browser's JavaScript code, do not worry as Browserify bundles it all up into a single neat and tidy JavaScript file which can be understood by the browser.

#### Using Browserify

Now to recursively bundle up all the required modules starting at web/js/advapp.js into a single file called advlib.js, use the following browserify command:

    browserify web/js/advapp.js -o web/js/advlib.js 

Finally, drop a single script tag into your index.html file and you are done!

``` html
<script src="js/advlib.js"></script>
```
